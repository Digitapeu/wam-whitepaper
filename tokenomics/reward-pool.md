# Reward Pool

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Overview" %}
| Token Amount | % of total supply |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| 458,000,000  | 45.8%             |
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

We decided to offer **most of the tokens (45.8%)** to our community, in the reward pool. These tokens will be released gradually each month for **120 months (10 years)** through a mining system based on each person's contribution to the platform. Some ideas would be the following:

* Inviting new players to join the platform
* Organising regular tournaments and bringing lots of players on them
* **Liquidity mining** – providing liquidity for our pools on DEXs
* **Locking** – lock tokens in a smart contract to receive rewards
* Publishing your hyper-casual games on WAM.app
* & others

We believe that in order to avoid inflation these rewards need to be distributed to our most loyal players who will bring value to our token & platform and indirectly help the project to succeed.
