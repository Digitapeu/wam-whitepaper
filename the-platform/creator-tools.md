# Creator Tools

As mentioned before, players on **WAM.app** can create their own _private tournaments_ where they can invite friends or their communities. Being a tournament host that brings value on the platform, means you will receive more **WAM Coin** rewards from the pool.&#x20;

In the near future, the creators will also be able to **build their own hyper-casual games** just with some simple instructions given to an **AI system**. With these games they can create even more engaging and fun tournaments where their communities can participate.

Below, is the first screen from the tournament creation panel. This allows any user from any compatible device to create their own custom tournament on pre-existing games to invite and play with friends of their choosing.

Likewise, creators will be able to create **custom NFTs** which will be distributed as rewards for the participants of their tournaments.

Here we believe games should build a stronger connection with their fans by minting special NFTs for each particular game. By releasing collectable items, users can then in the future participate in tournaments designed just for their preference
