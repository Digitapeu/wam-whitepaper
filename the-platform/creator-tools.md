As mentioned before, players on **WAM.app** can create their own _private tournaments_ where they can invite friends or their communities. Being a tournament host that brings value on the platform, means you will receive more **WAM Coin** rewards from the pool.&#x20;

In the near future, the creators will also be able to build their own hyper-casual games just with some simple instructions given to an AI system. With these games they can create even more engaging and fun tournaments where their communities can participate.

Likewise, creators will be able to create custom NFTs which will be distributed as rewards for the participants of their tournaments.
