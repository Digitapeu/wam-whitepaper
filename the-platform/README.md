# The Platform

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

### Our Games

**WAM.app** publishes simple-to-play, easy-to-learn, skill-based games generally called hyper-casual games. These games have easy to learn mechanics and do not require any type of previous knowledge from the player nor does it require vast amounts of time invested in mastering them.&#x20;

This makes hyper-casual games a favourite game genre for a very big audience: in 2020, _1.5 billion people_ considered themselves hyper-casual players.

### **Gameplay**

In order to play a game you'll have to _enter_ a public or private **tournament** of that game. Each tournament have different _entrance fees _and_ reward pools – _in **WAM Coins**. With each player who _enters_ a tournament, its _reward pool _increases by a fixed amount of** WAM Coins.**

All our games and tournaments are **skill based**. So when you're playing, the main goal is to make the best score and to get as high as possible in the rankings.

One can continue from a certain score (up to 3 times) by either paying a small fee in **WAM Coins**. Once the 3 tries are over, the game is automatically reset to 0 so everyone has the same opportunity to win, independently of a user’s funds.

You can see each tournament ranking in real time and easily notice when other players surpass your score and take your place.

### **Play to Earn**

Each tournament _reward distribution table_ will be visible and transparent at any times as long as the tournament is open. When its duration has ended the _rewards_ are allocated to a number of players that participated and had the best scores. Each player's wallet will be credited with the amount of **WAM Coins** he earned from the _reward pool_.

There are also other ways to earn **WAM Coins** rewards. These will be highlighted in the platform under the _Rewards Center_ / _Daily Challenges_ and will be frequently changed.

### Tournaments Discovery

There are 4 tournament walls: **Amateur**, **Semi-Pro**, **Pro** and **Legend **– where you can find public tournaments created by WAM.app team. This is a natural progression of skill, just like in real life. The more advanced the tournament, the more expensive is the entry fee which in turn makes for a bigger pool of **WAM Coins**.

The platform will also have a _discovery section_, where you can find _private tournaments_ created by other players. For the private tournaments the _entrance fee_ and other settings (like duration) are set by the tournament creator.

### **NFT Tournaments**

There is also a special type of tournaments: NFT tournaments. These are special because in order to _enter_ the player has to own a special **NFT pass**. The _entrance fee _will be zero and the reward pool will be guaranteed by the platform.

Players can get NFT passes either as a reward from the platform – as seen above – or by purchasing it from other players on the marketplace.

### **The Marketplace**

The marketplace will be the section where players will be able to trade not only **NFT passes** (for special tournaments) but also other kinds of NFTs like cool **avatars**, **reserved nicknames** or **badges**.
