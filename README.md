# WAM.app

**WAM.app** is a play-to-earn hypercasual social gaming platform where users can compete in skill based tournaments on simple yet very popular and highly engaging and entertaining games, to win WAM Coins, an ERC-20 utility token based on the Ethereum network.

Launched in February 2021 as public beta we reached more than **2.5m players** in less than 2 months with 10k people tournaments. After this initial success we decided to create the mobile apps where to this date they have been downloaded more than 30k times so far.

**WAM.app** was nominated as a finalist at this year’s Mobile Games Awards in an impressive line up of companies like Niantic and Huawei.

On **WAM.app**, the more a player wins the more their in-platform rank grows, just like normal real-life leaderboards in competitive sports. Once a player advances their rank they can participate in more rewarding tournaments with higher entrance fees & prize pools.

Each tournament has a prize pool made from the fees each participant pays to join the tournament and at the end of the tournament the prizes are distributed algorithmically to a percentage of the top players while 20% of the pool is the platform fee.

**WAM.app** was built with one vision in mind: to be accessible on any device and platform at any time meaning it’s accessible by going to https://wam.app or downloading the WAM.app from Google Play and App Store.

We got our inspiration from real life amateur sports tournaments where millions of people from all over the world compete in games like: football, basketball, rugby, tenis, billiards, darts and many more, just to have fun and spend time together with friends and family. The pandemic showed us the importance of sharing experiences and keeping in touch with our peers and doing it on a digital platform with people from all over the globe is the simplest way to do it.

On **WAM.app** players can: 

* participate in tournaments to win WAM Coins;
* create their own tournaments where they can invite their friends and set their own participation rules;
* create their own games with AI assisted technology using their phones;
* trade NFTs won in specific tournaments on the marketplace;
* build their player profile by winning tournaments;
* grow an audience of fans;
