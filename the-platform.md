# The Platform

### Mission

Our mission is simple: to increase the adoption of crypto through fun, competitive and easy to play games regardless of device without the need to know how the tech works.

### **Gameplay**

The games published on WAM are diverse and different, each having its own easy to learn mechanics. This is also where the novelty of the platform comes from: no matter what the game is, you can compete with other players on the games you like.\
\
One can continue from a certain score (up to 3 times) by either paying a small fee in WAM Coins or by watching a rewarded ad.\
\
Once the 3 tries are over, the game is automatically reset to 0 so everyone has the same opportunity to win, independently of a userâ€™s funds.

### **Play to earn**

There are 4 walls: Amateur, Semi-Pro, Pro and Legend. This is a natural progression of skill, just like in real life. The more advanced the tournament, the more expensive is the entry fee which in turn makes for a bigger pool of WAM Coins.

### **Rewards**

\- Daily WAM Coins for logging in\
\- 3 daily invites\
\- Frequent player\
\- Creator (makes games and tournaments) - get WAM Coins

### **NFT tournaments**

This will be a special type of tournament where the entry is not based on a fee but by owning a specific NFT. Users will have a chance at winning a % of the prize pool without having to pay an entrance fee.

### **Marketplace**

This is where users will be able to buy Jinxes (NFTs with special abilities like blocking a player mid-game to save the score), avatars, nicknames.

### **Creator tools**

Each user will be able to create:

* games using AI technology
* tournaments where each user sets the rules and shares the tournament with friends or social following
* NFTs to add as gifts in tournaments

### **Developer program**

Third party developer will be able to publish games on WAM and earn revenue from the tournaments made on their games**.**
